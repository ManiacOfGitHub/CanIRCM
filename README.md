# Can I RCM?

This tool tells you if your console is vulnerable to fusee-gelee. Check out the tool [here](https://canircm.com/).

Yes, I'm aware that all consoles can enter RCM, so this site should be called "Can I fusee-gelee?" but that doesn't roll off the tongue, you know?

This tool is heavily (and I mean heavily) based on the `.ssnc` command from the Discord bot [Kurisu](https://github.com/nh-server/Kurisu/blob/main/cogs/ssnc.py#L45).

Credit to [Nintendo Homebrew](https://github.com/nh-server) for doing most of the hard work.
